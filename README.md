## Idea
[Top](#skull\-project "Top")<br>
Kudos to Adafruit for their continuing work on the "Uncanny Eyes" project and specifically their "All Seeing Skull" project:
- https://learn.adafruit.com/hallowing-all-seeing-skull
  - https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/main/All_Seeing_Skull
- https://learn.adafruit.com/animated-electronic-eyes

I am making a build of the hallowing-all-seeing-skull using the Hallowing M4 Express.
- I was going to substitute the **RCWL-0516** Doppler Radar for the PIR Sensor but decided it wasn't a good choice for outdoor use.
- see https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/Skull-Project/blob/master/RCWL-0516/README.md if you are interested in the reasoning.

### Skull
[Top](#skull\-project "Top")<br>
As seen in the parts list, I chose a plastic skull for the project. The size is pretty good; a bit of a tight fit for the HalloWing, but it still looks quite good in practice.

### Eyeball - Hallowing M4 Express
[Top](#skull\-project "Top")<br>
The Hallowing M4 Express is amazing! It makes so many different eyeballs available and they are all beautiful!

As seen in the parts list, you can get some very nice fitted lenses to make the effect even better.

If using the USB Micro-B connector to power the Hallowing, leave the ID and data pins floating.

### Hallowing M0 Express
[Top](#skull\-project "Top")<br>
There is also an "M0" version with a lower resolution display, but still beautiful!

### PIR sensor
[Top](#skull\-project "Top")<br>
Will be using a PIR sensor instead of the radar sensor. Probably the one shown in the parts list.

It turns out that the plastic cover is actually a fresnel lens for infrared and not just protection or decoration. This unit has a lens of a size that should fit well in the skull eye-socket.

Also I think the version I ordered has a potentiometer adjustment for sensitivity which might come in handy.

This one uses 3.xV power so I may need to rethink my idea for how to power the project. I could go with 7.4V to a UBEC to 5V through the USB into the Hallowing and then use the 3.3V output for the PIR sensor. Alternatively I could power both Hallowing and sensor directly from the 3.7V batteries in parallel.

## Not Using for This project

### Not Using Doppler Radar - RCWL-0516
[Top](#skull\-project "Top")<br>
This doesn't seem to work well outside, so I won't be using it on this project. If more details are desired see the following
